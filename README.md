# Finger Counter App using OpenCV

Welcome to the Finger Counter App, a Python application using the OpenCV module to count the number of fingers in a live cam video frame. The app utilizes External Contour Detection to accurately detect and count the fingers in real time.

## Project Overview

The Finger Counter App is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the OpenCV module in Python for computer vision applications. It leverages the power of External Contour Detection to identify and count the number of fingers within a live cam video feed.

## Key Features

- **OpenCV Module:** Developed using the OpenCV library in Python, a powerful tool for computer vision applications.
- **External Contour Detection:** Utilizes External Contour Detection to accurately identify the boundaries of fingers in the video frame.

## Finger Counter App Features

- **Live Cam Feed:** Captures video from the live camera feed, enabling real-time finger counting.
- **External Contour Detection:** Applies contour detection to recognize the external boundaries of fingers.
- **Finger Count Display:** Dynamically displays the counted number of fingers on the video frame.
- **Threshold Adjustment:** Allows for threshold adjustments to enhance contour detection based on lighting conditions.
- **Simple User Interface:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the app.
